1 Dream Crazier

If we show emotion, we ’re called dramatic. If we want to play against men, we’re nuts. And if we dream of
equal opportunity, delusional. When we stand for something, we’re unhinged. When we’re too good, there’s
something wrong with us. And if we get angry, we’re hysterical, irrational, or just being crazy.
But a woman running a marathon was crazy. A woman boxing was crazy. A woman dunking, crazy.
Coaching an NBA team, crazy. A woman competing in a hijab; changing her sport; landing a double-cork
1080; or winning 23 Grand Slams, having a baby, and then coming back for more, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
and crazy.
So if they want to call you crazy, fine. Show them what crazy can do.


2 OMEGA: from a movement to a brand name

We always give names to the things that really matter. When a mechanical watch movement created in 1894
changed our industry forever, we called it Omega—a word synonymous with excellence, accomplishment
and achievement. In 1903, our founders gave the name to the entire company, and well over a century later,
we remain committed to that name and all that it stands for.
In 2007, our exclusive Co-Axial calibre signaled another revolution in watchmaking, redefining the potential
of the mechanical movement. This dedicated production line represents a seamless blend of human ingenuity
and automated perfection—a line worthy of the Co-Axial calibres we produce there. For our company, which
took its name from a movement in 1903, quality and innovation are still central to every timepiece we
produce.
OMEGA: Our name says it all.


3 The Art of War - Laying Plans (Excerpts)

By Sun Tzŭ
Translated by Lionel Giles
Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death,
a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
neglected.
Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is
fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many
calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at
all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.


4 The Art of War - The Army On The March (Excerpts)

By Sun Tzŭ
Translated by Lionel Giles
If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove
submissive; and, unless submissive, they will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have
become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless. Therefore
soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means
of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.
If in training soldiers’ commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well disciplined; if
not, its discipline will be bad. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on
his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.


5 The North Wind and The Sun

The North Wind and the Sun disputed as to which was the most powerful, and agreed that he
should be declared the victor who could first strip a wayfaring man of his clothes. The North
Wind first tried his power and blew with all his might, but the keener his blasts, the closer the
Traveler wrapped his cloak around him, until at last, resigning all hope of victory, the Wind
called upon the Sun to see what he could do. The Sun suddenly shone out with all his warmth.
The Traveler no sooner felt his genial rays than he took off one garment after another, and at
last, fairly overcome with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in his path.
Persuasion is better than Force.


6 Avaricious and Envious

Two neighbours came before Jupiter and prayed him to grant their hearts’ desire. Now the
one was full of avarice, and the other eaten up with envy. So to punish them both, Jupiter
granted that each might have whatever he wished for himself, but only on condition that his
neighbour had twice as much. The Avaricious man prayed to have a room full of gold. No
sooner said than done; but all his joy was turned to grief when he found that his neighbour
had two rooms full of the precious metal.
Then came the turn of the Envious man, who could not bear to think that his neighbour had
any joy at all. So he prayed that he might have one of his own eyes put out, by which means
his companion would become totally blind.
Vices are their own punishment.


7 YOU ARE A LIVING MAGNET

The Law of Attraction says that you are a “living magnet” and that you invariably attract
into your life the people, ideas, opportunities, and circumstances in harmony with your
dominant thoughts.
When you think positive, optimistic, loving, and successful thoughts, you create a force field
of magnetism that attracts, like iron filings to a magnet, the very things you are thinking
about. This law explains why it is that you don’t have to be concerned where your good is
going to come from. If you can keep your mind clearly focused on what you want, and refrain
from thinking about what you don’t want, you will attract everything you need to achieve
your goals, exactly when you are ready. Change your thinking and you change your life.


8 CHOOSE YOUR ROLE MODELS WITH CARE

There is nothing wrong with being thoughtful and concerned about the feelings and reactions
of others toward you and your choices. What is silly and self-defeating however, is for you to
allow yourself to be inordinately influenced by the fleeting opinions of people whose regard
and respect is of no concern or value to you. If you’ve been raised with destructive criticism,
you can easily slip into the trap of organizing your life around trying to gain the approval, or
escape the disapproval of people you don’t even know or care about.
When you select admirable people to look up to, you actually connect at an unconscious level
with a higher power that will then give you guidance and insight. You will experience a deep
inner knowing of exactly the right thing to do or say.


9 Questioning Darwin (1)

For those Christians who believe their Bible is the word of God, the literal truth, one man is
held up as the Antichrist — Charles Darwin — for leading millions of Christians astray with a
very different account of creation: evolution by natural selection. And it would take seven years
of intensive research before he felt ready to write to a trusted friend: “At last gleams of light
have come, & I am almost convinced (quite contrary to the opinion I started with) that species
are not immutable. It is like confessing a murder.”
“I have steadily endeavored to keep my mind free so as to give up any hypothesis, however
much beloved, as soon as the facts are shown to be opposed to it. I feel within me an instinct
for truth.”


10 Questioning Darwin (2)

If there was a single event that brought Darwin’s theory back into the spotlight, it was the launch
of Sputnik on the 4th of November, 1957. For the first time in history, creationists fought back,
using an entirely new tactic — they would fight science with science: orthodox science with
creation science.
Darwin himself never stopped asking questions about his science and about God. “In my most
extreme fluctuations, I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of God.
I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might
just as well speculate on the mind of Newton.” It was the final humble admission from one of
the greatest minds of all time.
