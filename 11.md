11 Part One: Trial of the Century

Los Angeles, California — a town famous for sunshine, celebrities, and scandal. But even by
L.A. standards, the events of June 1994 were electrifying. In an affluent suburb, two people
were found brutally murdered. The prime suspect was a football star-turned-film actor. All
eyes focused on the Los Angeles County Courthouse as the trial unfolded like a Hollywood
movie. For 10 months, the State of California versus Orenthal James Simpson played out in
the courtroom and on televisions around the world. On October 3rd, 1995, the world held its
breath as the jury rendered its decision.
The verdict was a shot to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys who tried the case and to
the families of the victims, but for the defense it was confirmation that the quality of the
evidence must be weighed before depriving a person of his freedom.


12 Part Two: O. J. Simpson Sentenced for Hotel Robbery

O. J. Simpson stood shackled and stone-faced as a Las Vegas judge sentenced him for a hotel
armed robbery. The 61-year-old football Hall of Famer was sentenced Friday to at least 15 years.
The judge called Simpson arrogant and ignorant. She also said the evidence against him in this
case was overwhelming and stressed it was not in retribution for his 1995 double murder
acquittal.
Before the sentencing, an emotional Simpson made a rambling 5-minute plea for leniency. But
the judge rejected the apology, saying it wasn’t much more than stupidity. She said that someone
could have been hurt or even killed during the confrontation. Simpson’s sisters and adult
daughter sat in the front row of the courtroom, Fred Goldman and his daughter Kim, the father
and sister of murder victim Ron Goldman, were also there.

No “Tyranny of the OR” (Embrace the “Genius of the AND”)
A visionary company doesn’t simply balance between idealism and profitability; it seeks to be highly idealistic and highly profitable. 
A visionary company doesn’t simply balance between preserving a tightly held core ideology and stimulating vigorous change and movement; it does both to an extreme. 
In short, a highly visionary company doesn’t want to blend yin and yang into a gray, indistinguishable circle that is neither highly yin nor highly yang; 
it aims to be distinctly yin and distinctly yang — both at the same time, all the time.

Irrational? Perhaps. Rare? Yes. Difficult? Absolutely. 
But as F. Scott Fitzgerald pointed out, “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.
” This is exactly what the visionary companies are able to do.

Words or Deeds?
How can we be sure that the core ideologies of highly visionary companies represent more than just a bunch of nice-sounding platitudes — words with no bite, 
words meant merely to pacify, manipulate, or mislead? 
We have two answers. First, social psychology research strongly indicates that when people publicly espouse a particular point of view, 
they become much more likely to behave consistent with that point of view even if they did not previously hold that point of view. In other words, 
the very act of stating a core ideology (which the visionary companies have done to a far greater degree than the comparison companies) influences behavior toward consistency with that ideology.

Second — and more important — the visionary companies don’t merely declare an ideology; 
they also take steps to make the ideology pervasive throughout the organization and transcend any individual leader.


15 The Impact of the Social Dilemma

It’s a little even trite to say now, but… because we don’t pay for the products that we
use, advertisers pay for the products that we use. Advertisers are the customers. We’re
the thing being sold. The classic saying is: If you’re not paying for the product, then
you are the product.
We’ve created a world in which online connection has become primary, especially for
younger generations. And yet, in that world, any time two people connect, the only way
it’s financed is through a sneaky third person who’s paying to manipulate those two
people. So, we’ve created an entire global generation of people who are raised within a
context where the very meaning of communication, the very meaning of culture, is
manipulation. We’ve put deceit and sneakiness at the absolute center of everything we
do.


16 How to Get Rid of the Social Dilemma?

If something is a tool, it genuinely is just sitting there, waiting patiently. If something
is not a tool, it’s demanding things from you. It’s seducing you. It’s manipulating you.
It wants things from you. And we’ve moved away from having a tools-based
technology environment to an addiction-and-manipulation-based technology
environment. That’s what’s changed. Social media isn’t a tool that’s just waiting to be
used. It has its own goals, and it has its own means of pursuing them by using your
psychology against you.
The attention extraction model is not how we want to treat human beings. The fabric
of a healthy society depends on us getting off this corrosive business model. We can
demand that these products be designed humanely. We can demand to not be treated
as an extractable resource. The intention could be: “How do we make the world
better?”


17 The Mother Tongue - English and How It Got That Way

More than 300 million people in the world speak English and the rest, it sometimes seems, try to. 
It would be charitable to say that the results are sometimes mixed.
To be fair, English is full of booby traps for the unwary foreigner. 
Any language where the unassuming word fly signifies an annoying insect, a means of travel, 
and a critical part of a gentleman's apparel is clearly asking to be mangled. 
If there is one thing certain about English pronunciation it is that there is almost nothing certain about it. 
No other language in the world has more words spelled the same way and yet pronounced differently.
Spellings in English are so treacherous, 
and opportunities for flummoxing so abundant, 
that the authorities themselves sometimes stumble.
For better or worse, English has become the most global of languages, 
the lingua franca of business, science, education, politics, and pop music.


18 The Mother Tongue - English and How It Got That Way

There are two ways of rendering speech into writing. One is with an alphabet, 
such as we have, or a pictographic-ideographic system, such as the Chinese use. 
However, Chinese writing possesses one great advantage over other languages: It can be read everywhere. 
Chinese is not really a language at all, but more a family of loosely related dialects. 
The ideographs are pronounced differently in different areas but read the same.
An equally useful advantage of written Chinese is that people can read the literature of 2,500 years ago as easily as yesterday’s newspapers, 
even though the spoken language has changed beyond recognition. 
If Confucius were to come back to life today, no one apart from scholars would understand what he was saying, 
but if he scribbled a message people could read it as easily as they could a shopping list.


19 Do Schools Kill Creativity? (Excerpts)

By Ken Robinson

Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. 
And there's a reason. The whole system was invented — round the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. 
They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. 

So their hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. 
So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, 
on the grounds you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? 

And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, 
because the universities designed the system in their image. 
If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. 

And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, 
because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, 
or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way.
